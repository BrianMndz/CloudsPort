Handover Document: Clouds Port to JUCE Plugin
Project Overview
We are porting the Clouds granular audio processor, originally designed for embedded hardware, to a JUCE-based audio plugin. The goal is to maintain core functionality while adapting to a desktop plugin environment.
Current Status
Completed Components

CloudsParameters: Adapted for JUCE's AudioProcessorValueTreeState
CloudsAudioBuffer: Bridge between JUCE's AudioBuffer and original buffer concept
Grain: Basic implementation of individual grain processing unit
GranularSamplePlayer: Initial implementation of the granular synthesis engine

Partial Implementations

GranularProcessor: Basic structure implemented, needs integration with GranularSamplePlayer
PluginProcessor: Basic JUCE plugin structure set up, needs full integration with Clouds DSP

Next Steps

Refine GranularSamplePlayer

Implement more sophisticated grain scheduling algorithms
Add stereo spreading of grains
Implement various grain envelope shapes
Fine-tune parameter scaling and mapping


Fully Integrate GranularSamplePlayer with GranularProcessor

Update processGranular method to use GranularSamplePlayer
Ensure proper buffer handling between JUCE audio thread and Clouds DSP


Implement WSOLASamplePlayer

Port the time-stretching algorithm from the original Clouds
Integrate with GranularProcessor for stretch mode


Develop LoopingSamplePlayer

Implement looping delay functionality
Integrate with GranularProcessor for looping delay mode


Begin PhaseVocoder Implementation

Start porting the spectral processing capabilities
This will be needed for the spectral mode


Expand Effect Modules

Implement Reverb effect
Port Diffuser functionality
Add PitchShifter module


Enhance Parameter Management

Implement parameter smoothing for click-free changes
Add MIDI CC mapping capabilities


Start GUI Development

Design main plugin interface
Implement basic parameter controls (knobs, sliders, buttons)



Important Considerations

Memory Management

The original Clouds used fixed memory allocation. We've transitioned to dynamic allocation where appropriate.
Be mindful of real-time audio constraints when allocating memory.


Audio Buffer Handling

We're using JUCE's AudioBuffer wrapped in our custom CloudsAudioBuffer.
The wrapper maintains a circular buffer behavior crucial for granular processing.


Playback Modes

Currently, only the basic structure for granular mode has been implemented.
Other modes (spectral, pitch shift, looping delay) need to be developed and integrated.


DSP Algorithms

Some DSP algorithms may need optimization for real-time plugin performance.
Consider SIMD optimizations where applicable.


Sample Rate and Buffer Size Handling

Ensure the plugin can handle various sample rates and buffer sizes common in DAW environments.



Potential Challenges

Maintaining low latency and CPU efficiency in a plugin environment.
Accurately reproducing the unique sound character of the hardware version.
Adapting hardware-specific optimizations to work efficiently on various desktop CPUs.

Resources

Original Embedded Clouds source code (provided in the project repository)
JUCE documentation and forums for plugin-specific implementations
Original Clouds manual for understanding the full feature set and user interactions

Testing

Implement unit tests for core DSP components as they are developed.
Continuously compare audio output with the original hardware for quality assurance.
Test with various buffer sizes and sample rates to ensure stability.

Version Control
The project is using Git for version control. Please commit regularly and provide clear, descriptive commit messages.

This handover document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the project and outlines the next steps for continuing the Clouds port to a JUCE plugin. It should give the next engineer a clear understanding of what has been done and what needs to be tackled next.
